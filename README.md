The development of *GUYA* was broken down into three parts; frontend, middleware and backend, with the intention of completing certain key features to enable the user to have a smooth and quick log-in to registration process. The app is developed in a span of two weeks, incorporating key features such as the log-in page, profiling page and automated portfolio page. For the full, conceptualised features, please refer to our [Figma ideation workspace](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1067377445672713926).
