The development of *GUYA* was broken down into three parts; frontend, middleware and backend, with the intention of completing certain key features to enable the user to have a smooth and quick log-in to registration process. The app is developed in a span of two weeks, incorporating key features such as the log-in page, profiling page and automated portfolio page. For the full, conceptualised features, please refer to our [Figma ideation workspace](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1067377445672713926).

 ## 2. Log-in/Registration page
 Integrated Auth0 with React. Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to GUYA.

Auth0 helps us to avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building our own solution to authenticate and authorize users.
I also enabled the use of Google and Github authentication-authorization as I figured convenience is key, especially for many first-time app users. 
  
  ## 3. Profile page
  The profile page of the user is then displayed. The "Tell us more, young bull!" button allows the app to bring the user to the profiling page.

  ## 4. Profiling page
  After registration, the user is required to fill up a simple questionnaire to find out more about the user's budgeting goals and finances. The key feature of this form is that it allows user to input values so as to feed and retrieve data to and from the backend, followed by displaying the automated portfolio splits as per the next page.

  </p>
  
  ## 5. Automated Portfolio page
  Based on the inputs of the user, the backend will feed data into the front end to display the desired portfolio splits. The automated portfolio splits are categorised into three main categories, namely: 1.Savings, 2.Spendings, 3.Investments

  # Moving forward
  Despite being only given a week for the project timeline, my team and I are grateful for this opportunity to develop a small portion of GUYA as part of NUS FintechSG. Moving forward, we would wish to continue to further develop and enhance the app. Any feedbacks or suggestions will be very happily received.
